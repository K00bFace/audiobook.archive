            This is K00b's audiobook Archive. It is a archive of audiobook libraries. It is also a growing project.
            The search box below allows users to search for audiobooks and visit their sites and listen to the audiobooks
            at the users leisure. This is a reletively simple project but I haven't had experience with javascript before
            so it is a difficult one for me. I hope this projects gives others access to audiobooks that they want and I 
            hope it give me, K00bFace and those who have kept up with the progress of this site, an oppertunity to learn 
            more about a very commonly used language, JavaScript. Thank you for visiting my site and I hope you have a nice day.
